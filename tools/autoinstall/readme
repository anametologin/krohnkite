[Deskription]
This tool was written to automatically install/update krohnkite*.kwinscript files in a specified folder. This is only useful for developers.
I use it on my Arch Linux virtual mashine. I drag and drop a build into virtual mashine, and it installs automatically.

Uninstall script was generated by LLM. It based on install.py, so I can proudly call myself a vibecoder. According
to the laws of my country, I now get one lavender raf a day. My doctor reassured me that hair won't grow on my palms.
So... It looks like that's all the useful information in this section.
